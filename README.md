# Business-Boardroom
It is a full-stack application that simulates structured conversations between marketing team members using multi-agent Generative AI. Designed for product ideation, marketing analysis, and strategic decision-making, it integrates with Slack to allow agent interactions in team channels, as well as a standalone frontend website for web-based simulations. At its core, it uses LangGraph to coordinate the flow of conversation between intelligent agents—CEO, Marketing Strategist, and Marketing Intern—each powered by few-shot prompting and controlled generation techniques. The app supports long context windows to maintain continuity across agent turns, and uses structured output for clean integration with enterprise tools or further evaluation pipelines.
